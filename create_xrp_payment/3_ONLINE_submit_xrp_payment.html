		<h1>Submit an XRP Transaction</h1>
		<h2>NOTE: I think it's safer not to SUBMIT the transaction with the same 'Ripple-Lib JavaScript API' I've been using to PREPARE the transaction. There's a small possibility 'bad actors' could hide unauthorised code in the Javascript files which could hide your 'Secret' within the transaction Blob during the signing process. If you use the same Javascript file to submit, they could conceivably extract the 'Secret' from the Blob and send it to themselves online. As far as I know, the WebSocket is closed source and based on a different code base, it would therefore be much harder to coordinate hidden exploits in both code bases.</h2>
